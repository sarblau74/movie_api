        wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh
        | bash<br />
  
        Now its time to create a directory using following code in terminal<br />

        mkdir movie_api <br />
        * Navigate into the "movie_api" directory<br />
        cd movie_api <br />
        * Create a JavaScript file called "test.js" within the "movie_api"
        directory<br />
        touch test.js <br />
  
        In EX 2.2: Create a documentaion.html,test.js, index.html,server.js,
